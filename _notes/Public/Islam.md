The key step to being a Muslim is the [Shahada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada): the acceptance of Mohammed as the last prophet, and the Koran as the direct word of Allah. As such I was driven to read the Koran, to understand what is being accepted. Most passages so far have fallen under 2 group
- Be kind to each other ( and what that means in practice )
- The importance of being a believer

As I read the Koran, trying to find what leads one to convert or not, I focused on passages that were misaligned with my own understanding of being morally correct. The misalignment might come from
1. Translation problems ( I don't read Arabic )
2. Misunderstanding the message being shared
3. A core disagreement between the message of the Koran and my own core beliefs

In an attempt to figure out the above, I list below the relevant passages. The passages are structured as 🔵 Chapter:Verse Passage, where the circle colour is, from big to small: 🔴 🟠 🟡 🟢

# 🔴 Problematic

> [2:191](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=191) : Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out.

In the modern day the idea of actively killing people seems hard to justify.

> [2:223](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=223) : Your wives are like farmland for you
> [4:34](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=34) : Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺.2 But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great.

Objectification of women

> [3:7](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=7) : He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive.1 Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah. As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.

What are the guidelines to distinguish the good/clear verses from the bad/elusive ones?

> [48:13](https://quran.com/48?startingVerse=13) : And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We surely have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire.

So people who were never presented to Islam will automatically spend eternity suffering?

> [9:5](https://quran.com/9?startingVerse=5) : But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists ˹who violated their treaties˺ wherever you find them,1 capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Is there any way this is not incentivising violence?
# 🟡 Unexpected

> [2:222](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=222) : When they purify themselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by Allah.

Menstruation is treated as being dirty?

# 🟢 Pet peeve

> [2:196](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=196) : And do not shave your heads

Pet peeve: I'm balding








48:16
# Areas for exploration

# Creationism
The standard and often repeated question: How is Creationism and Evolution reconciled into a unified view?

## Sanaa Manuscript
Does the Sanaa manuscript from 1972 mismatch the mainstream Quran?
Any differences between the upper and lower texts?

## Carbon Dating issues
References from [The Qur'an and its biblical reflexes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quran-Its-Biblical-Reflexes-Investigations/dp/1498569455) point to pages of the Quran being carbon dated to 388-535, predating Muhammad's birth by 35 years. 
Is [The Qur'an and its biblical reflexes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quran-Its-Biblical-Reflexes-Investigations/dp/1498569455) not a reliable source? ( Need to look int otheir sources )

## Inconsistent interlocutor
Some verses seem to be written by people talking about God, others God talking to people. Shouldn't we always have the latter?

God speaking to us: [4:31](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=31), [5:12](https://quran.com/5?startingVerse=12)
People speaking to God: [3:193](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=193), [47:2](https://quran.com/47?startingVerse=2), [64:9](https://quran.com/64?startingVerse=9)

## Standardisation of the Qur'an
> During the rule of one of Muhammad's later successors, the caliph Uthman (r. 644–656), **a standardised copy of the Qur'an was compiled and distributed to the main centres of the Islamic Empire**

Isn't the Qur'an the direct word from God, at which point "standardising" it means modifying the original word? Is the original word still available?

## Naskh
When Qur'anic verses are contradicting, how do we decide which to follow? How come we have contradicting verses at all?
Example: [43:89](https://quran.com/43?startingVerse=89) spreads a message of peace towards disbelievers, while [9:29](https://quran.com/9?startingVerse=29) demands disbelievers to be fought unless they become believers or pay tax.

## Convenient timing of the Surah's

> A concept of 'Jihad', defined as 'struggle', has been introduced by the Quran. While Muhammad was in Mecca, he "did not have many supporters and was very weak compared to the Pagans", and "it was at this time he added some 'soft', peaceful verses", whereas "almost all the hateful, coercive and intimidating verses later in the Quran were made with respect to Jihad" when Muhammad was in Medina .

Given the imemorialness of the Quran / word of Allah, introducing Surah's at the right time to play politics with the spread of paganism feels strange
